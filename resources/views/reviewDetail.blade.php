                I'm a big fan of the game. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners delivered on fronts. It's a gritty and depressing look at what goes on in night city. The action is astonishingly good, animated by trigger the studio behind classics like Kill <br>la kill, they did a really good job. Edgerunners is really faithful to the game, from locations, characters, UI, and sounds, it's truly amazing to see the world of cyberpunk 2077 animated for our televisions. The story and characters are on par with the actual game, you cannot skip this one. 
                CYBERPUNK: EDGERUNNERS is an anime that was able to set up an incredibly overpowering atmosphere from just the first episode. For those that are unaware, this is an anime based within the world of a video game called Cyberpunk 2077<br> released in 2020. However, there is a tabletop role-playing game first published in 1988 titled Cyberpunk that this world was invented from. Needless to say, Cyberpunk's world is one with extensive history.
And yet, CYBERPUNK: EDGERUNNERS clearly has it's roots planted firmly in the video game. <br>The grimy streets of Night City and the sweltering dessert of a drought-stricken northern California are nearly identical to the<br> point that hardcore fans of the game will recognize more than just a few locations.
Atmosphere. Set in the imaginary place of Night City decades into the future, mega-corporations wage wars above the drug and crime-filled streets. Cybernetic upgrades that trade your own flesh for metal can grant you unimaginable st<br>rength and even make you bullet proof. Within this cesspit of a city, cyber punks (A.K.A. edge runners) will do anything to earn money and have their names written down as legends. This dark dystopian world was something that the anime was able to convey brilliantly. From paywalls on your own washing machine to being denied healthcare and left to die if you're poor. <br><br>You're constantly left deeply disturbed by the scenes that unfold around you. Many a time I found myself pausing and rewinding when I saw something I didn't believe would be real. Ultimately, the world and atmosphere is the strongest part of this show. <br> om the first second you saw him. The outlier is ultimately David, the main character. He grew up poor with his mother who worked tirelessly to get him into an expensive academy and out of the slums, that's his mom's dream, not David's. David never knew what he wanted and even though he's rebellious
